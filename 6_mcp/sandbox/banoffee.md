## Yield
1 (9-inch) pie

## Ingredients
*   1 (13.4 ounce) can dulce de leche
*   1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
*   1/3 cup white sugar
*   2 teaspoons ground ginger (Optional)
*   6 tablespoons butter, melted
*   3 bananas, sliced
*   1 1/2 cups heavy cream
*   3 tablespoons powdered sugar
*   chocolate shavings (Optional)
*   espresso powder (Optional)

## Directions
1.  **Prepare the crust:** Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). In a medium bowl, mix graham cracker crumbs, white sugar, optional ground ginger, and melted butter. Press mixture into an ungreased 9-inch fluted tart pan with a removable bottom or a 9-inch pie plate.
2.  **Bake the crust:** Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until set. Cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes.
3.  **Assemble the pie:** Spread dulce de leche evenly in the cooled crust. Arrange banana slices on top of the dulce de leche.
4.  **Make whipped cream:** In a large bowl, beat heavy cream and powdered sugar until stiff peaks form (about 3 minutes). Spread the whipped cream over the bananas.
5.  **Chill and serve:** Refrigerate the pie for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight. Before serving, sprinkle with chocolate shavings, cocoa powder, and/or espresso powder, if desired.

## Storage
Cover the pie and store it in the refrigerator for up to five days. Freezing is not recommended as it may not thaw well, but it can be frozen for up to three months if necessary.
