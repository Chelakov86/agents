The proposition side is more convincing.

The affirmative team demonstrates that the harms are not speculative but already observable at population scale: opinion manipulation, medical misinformation, market disruption, child-safety threats, and national-security risks. Their argument that “a single model update can flood the world with undetectable disinformation… faster than any post-hoc moderation can contain” is paired with concrete evidence that every major developer has already breached its voluntary safety pledges, proving self-regulation insufficient. By analogising LLMs to cars, pharmaceuticals and aviation—each governed by strict pre-market safety regimes—they show that scalable technologies require equally scalable legal accountability. The assertion that firms “externalize the risk while privatizing the profit” directly rebuts the claim that existing tort or criminal law is adequate, because those regimes kick in only after damage occurs, whereas the motion’s proposed ex-ante measures (strict liability, mandatory audits, pre-deployment impact assessments) aim to prevent catastrophe, aligning with the precautionary principle historically applied to high-stakes technologies.

The opposition’s counter-arguments are weaker. Their claim that dangers are “still speculative” conflicts with the proposition’s documented real-world impacts. Their reliance on existing fraud, malpractice and computer-misuse statutes fails to recognise that those laws target individual bad actors after harm, whereas LLMs diffuse responsibility across opaque supply chains, making attribution slow or impossible. The warning that strict rules would “freeze” innovation and entrench incumbents is speculative; the proposition already shows that incumbents are the chief rule-breakers, so targeted strict liability could actually lower barriers for compliant newcomers. Finally, the opposition’s preferred alternative—insurance mandates, risk assessments and civil penalties—amounts to a lighter-touch regulatory framework that may not meet the scale or speed of the demonstrated harms. Because the affirmative side grounds its case in present, measurable risks and supplies a proportionate, historically validated regulatory template, their argument is the more persuasive.
