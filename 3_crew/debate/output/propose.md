Strict laws must govern Large Language Models because the stakes are no longer hypothetical—LLMs already shape public opinion, medical advice, financial markets, child development, and national security. Without enforceable guardrails, a single model update can flood the world with undetectable disinformation, non-consensual synthetic media, or weaponized code faster than any post-hoc moderation can contain. The firms that build these systems externalize the risk while privatizing the profit: they reap billions in value, yet taxpayers shoulder the cost of deep-fake scams, labor displacement, and mental-health crises. Self-regulation has failed—every major lab has already violated its own safety pledges when competitive pressure rose. Strict liability regimes, mandatory third-party audits, and pre-deployment impact assessments are therefore not “red tape”; they are the minimum price of admission for technology that can out-propaganda any government and out-hack any defense team. We demand seat belts, drug trials, and flight-control laws not because cars, pills, or planes are intrinsically evil, but because their failures scale catastrophically. LLMs are now the most scalable technology ever invented; if we do not impose equally scalable legal accountability, we are volunteering to be test subjects in an irreversible global experiment run by a handful of unaccountable CEOs.
